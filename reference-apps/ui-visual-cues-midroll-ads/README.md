# Drawing UI cues for ads
The present sample showcases how to draw cues for the upcoming ads based on their timeoffset.

To keep the page simple, we moved to this readme notes and useful resources.

## About the player implementation
The present samples are meant to be used with the NPM-installed player. Get your NPM web player on https://www.npmjs.com/package/theoplayer.

Alternatively, you can also generate a custom player on THEOportal.

### Check the URLs
Once you have installed your player, check whether the following URLs need changing to point to the folder containing the player SDK:
* UI CSS library: `href="../../node_modules/theoplayer/ui.css"`
* THEOplayer library: `src="../../node_modules/theoplayer/THEOplayer.js"`
* libraryLocation: `libraryLocation: "../../node_modules/theoplayer/"`

### License
The license included in the implementation only allows for playback on _localhost_.
To play on any other domains, as well as to make sure your license doesn't expire, get your license on https://portal.theoplayer.com.

## Customizing UI elements
In THEOplayer, you can decide to use the chromeless SDK, to build a completely custom UI, or the chromeful SDK, which you can tweak and adapt to your implementation.

The present sample showcases how add cues on the timeline to indicate when the upcoming ads are.

### About customizing the default UI
In THEOplayer, the default UI already includes the features and controls that are most common across implementations and use cases. You may decide to add, delete or tweak its elements to adapt the player to your implementation.

Check the other samples for other UI customizations, and the links below for related resources.

### Additional notes about timeline cues
* <u>Limitations</u> - The present sample has limitations and caveats and is not implementation-ready as is. Its aim is simply to show that it is relatively easy to draw cues for ads. 
* <u>Other timeline cues</u> - The same logic can be applied to signal with cues other events on the timeline, such as goals in a match, content changes (slides, speakers, current program, etc.) and may be customized.
