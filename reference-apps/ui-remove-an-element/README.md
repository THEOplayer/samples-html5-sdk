# Removing UI elements
The present sample showcases how to remove UI elements in CSS and in JavaScript.

To keep the page simple, we moved to this readme notes and useful resources.

## About the player implementation
The present samples are meant to be used with the NPM-installed player. Get your NPM web player on https://www.npmjs.com/package/theoplayer.

Alternatively, you can also generate a custom player on THEOportal.

  <summary>Making sure the player is implemented correctly: <u>URLs and license</u></summary>

### Check the URLs
Once you have installed your player, check whether the following URLs need changing to point to the folder containing the player SDK:
* UI CSS library: `href="../../node_modules/theoplayer/ui.css"`
* THEOplayer library: `src="../../node_modules/theoplayer/THEOplayer.js"`
* libraryLocation: `libraryLocation: "../../node_modules/theoplayer/"`

### License
The license included in the implementation only allows for playback on _localhost_.
To play on any other domains, as well as to make sure your license doesn't expire, get your license on https://portal.theoplayer.com.

## Customizing UI elements
In THEOplayer, you can decide to use the chromeless SDK, to build a completely custom UI, or the chromeful SDK, which you can tweak and adapt to your implementation.

The present sample showcases how add a custom quality selector submenu which, based on mp4 files, simulates the usual menu built automatically from HLS or DASH renditions.

### About customizing the default UI
In THEOplayer, the default UI already includes the features and controls that are most common across implementations and use cases. You may decide to add, delete or tweak its elements to adapt the player to your implementation.

Check the other samples for other UI customizations, and the links below for related resources.

### Additional notes about removing elements
* <u>Hiding elements</u> - There are cases when removing elements will not do, but hiding them may be a solution. In such cases, make sure they are also not detectable/interactive when hovering them with the cursor. 
* <u>Related elements</u> - Removing an element may influence other elements positions or aspect. The way in which an element is removed or made invisible may also influence the result.
