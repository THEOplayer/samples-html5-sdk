# Showing captions
The present sample showcases a THEOplayer implementation with subtitles both in-stream and sideloaded, where the user can choose the desired subtitles through the control bar.
Here, the subtitles are shown by default on the stream. 

To keep the page simple, we moved to this readme notes and useful resources.

## About the player implementation

### Check the URLs

* libraryLocation: `libraryLocation: "../../node_modules/theoplayer/"`

### License

## Using textTracks for captions
In THEOplayer, you can use textTracks for many purposes, including subtitles and closed captions. These appear on the UI, and may be styled.
The present sample showcases how to select by default a specific track, and provides information about the track changes in the console.
