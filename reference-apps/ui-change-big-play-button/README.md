# Changing the big play button
The present sample showcases a few customizations applied to the big play button in THEOplayer.

To keep the page simple, we moved to this readme notes and useful resources.

## About the player implementation
The present samples are meant to be used with the NPM-installed player. Get your NPM web player on https://www.npmjs.com/package/theoplayer.

Alternatively, you can also generate a custom player on THEOportal.

  <summary>Making sure the player is implemented correctly: <u>URLs and license</u></summary>

### Check the URLs
Once you have installed your player, check whether the following URLs need changing to point to the folder containing the player SDK:
* UI CSS library: `href="../../node_modules/theoplayer/ui.css"`
* THEOplayer library: `src="../../node_modules/theoplayer/THEOplayer.js"`
* libraryLocation: `libraryLocation: "../../node_modules/theoplayer/"`

### License
The license included in the implementation only allows for playback on _localhost_.
To play on any other domains, as well as to make sure your license doesn't expire, get your license on  https://portal.theoplayer.com.

## Customizing UI elements
In THEOplayer, you can decide to use the chromeless SDK, to build a completely custom UI, or the chromeful SDK, which you can tweak and adapt to your implementation.
The present sample showcases one way to add and position custom UI elements in the default THEOplayer UI.

### About customizing the default UI
In THEOplayer, the default UI already includes the features and controls that are most common across implementations and use cases. You may decide to add, delete or tweak its elements to adapt the player to your implementation.

Check the other samples for other UI customizations, and the links below for related resources.

### Additional notes about customizing the big play button
* <u>Further changes</u> - In this example we changed the button with an image and made it responsive to hovering. Other changes may also be applied, including color, size and position. You may otherwise also decide to remove the default button and use a completely custom one.
* <u>UI skinning</u> - Specifically regarding colors, you might want to consistently use a definite color set for your big play button and the rest of your UI elements. The demo linked below helps you make these changes easily.
